Image Classification

# <u>*Brain  tumor Image Classification*</u>

*In this Project , will will try to predict 4 types of brain tumor based on based on a dataset that have brain tumor images .*

*This will be done by applying convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) wich is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery*

* <u>*Brief description about the 4 brain tumor types :*</u>

1. ***Meningioma**, also known as meningeal tumor, is typically a slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Symptoms depend on the location and occur as a result of the tumor pressing on nearby tissue.Many cases never produce symptoms.Occasionally seizures, dementia, trouble talking, vision problems, one sided weakness, or loss of bladder control may occur.

2. ***A glioma** is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or the spine.Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours.[for more information : wiki/Glioma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma)*

3. ***A pituitary tumor** is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland in the brain. It is located behind the back of the nose. It makes hormones that affect many other glands and many functions in your body. Most pituitary tumors are not cancerous (benign). They donâ€™t spread to other parts of your body. But they can cause the pituitary to make too few or too many hormones, causing problems in the body.[for more information : hopkinsmedicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pituitary-tumors#:~:text=A%20pituitary%20tumor%20is%20an,many%20functions%20in%20your%20body.)*

4. ***A non-cancerous (benign) (notumor)** soft tissue tumour is a growth that does not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Non-cancerous tumours are not usually life-threatening. They are typically removed with surgery and do not usually come back (recur)[for more information : CanadianCancerSociety](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/what-is-soft-tissue-sarcoma/non-cancerous-tumours#:~:text=A%20non%2Dcancerous%20(benign),non%2Dcancerous%20soft%20tissue%20tumours.)*
